[![git](assets\images\img\git.jpg)](\git_trick) 

I found this cleaver little trick and I thought that it could be useful to share.

That or you can show off some cool trivia to your friends and colleagues on how git-fluent you are.
<p class="doublesubtext">
  Just browse to
  <a href="https://repo.new">
 repo.new</a>
</p>
```
repo.new
```
Put that bad boy in your browser URL bar and **BAM**. Ready to make a new repo.
