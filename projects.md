<ul uk-accordion="" class="uk-accordion">
          <li class="">
            <a class="uk-accordion-title code" href="#">ZINE</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">

            <h4>I was published in a hacker zine once. </h4>
              <p>I was published in a hacker zine once. It is more theory of Social Engineering and a Hacker mindset than technical but you can check it out <a href="assets\files\lainzine03.pdf">here</a> (My article is on page 45)</p>
              <i>Note: The veiws in this zine do not necessarily refeflct mine nor do I necessarily endorse anything publish winthin said zine</i>
            </div>
          </li>
</ul>
<ul uk-accordion="" class="uk-accordion">
          <li class="">
            <a class="uk-accordion-title code" href="#">CTFd Auto Submit</a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
            <img src="assets\images\img\flag.jpg" alt="flag">
            <h4>CTFd Auto Submitter </h4>
              <p>This was a quick little script I whipped up for those challenges that always have a <i>Who Can submit <b>FLAG</b> first</i> type questions. Typically the flag is given before the CTF starts. Check it out
<a href="https://github.com/bishop-exe/CTFD-Auto">here</a>. </p>
              <i>Note: This is current only set up to use CTFs that are hosted with the CTFd platform. I am sure it can be used else where with a little tweaking.</i>
            </div>
          </li>
</ul>

<ul uk-accordion="" class="uk-accordion">
          <li class="">
            <a class="uk-accordion-title code" href="#">Malware Experimentation with CNN </a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
            <img src="assets\images\img\cnn.jpg" alt="nn">
            <h4>Malware Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks </h4>
              <p>Classifies a binary as malware or not malware by converting the binary to a grayscale image and running it through a CNN. The dataset can be made from the zoo and system binaries. A replicated project but <a href="https://github.com/jmcs811">jmcs811</a> and I wanted to play around with some ideas. More information on projects relating to this can be found at this <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8328749">IEEE</a> paper or the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04448.pdf">R2-D2</a> paper. Also, more interestingly this <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8703786">IEEE paper</a> on how to evade such classifications. </p>

<ul uk-accordion="" class="uk-accordion">
          <li class="">
            <a class="uk-accordion-title code" href="#">Automated Unpacking </a>
            <div class="uk-accordion-content" aria-hidden="true" hidden="">
            <img src="assets\images\img\unpack.jpg" alt="unpack">
            <h4>A tool used to automatically extract packed binaries. </h4>
              <p>I was a project lead for a tool that used a plugin based architecture to extract, unpack, and deobfuscate malware. I also presented findings and successes at a Reverse Engineering Expo. </p>

            <h4>Ill let you know when I figure that out </h4>
              <p>I am always open to new ideas though. Have your people get with someone or something. I forget the phrase.</p>
